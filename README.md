## Stress Detection
This project is implementing classification task of stress detection from a dataset of 4 million wearable medical device data using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

### Dataset
For this project, I have used [WESAD Dataset](https://www.eti.uni-siegen.de/ubicomp/home/datasets/icmi18/index.html.en?lang=en)
This dataset has data of total 15 subjects. Total number of records are more than 4 million.
Dataset has data from two devices - 
    i. Chest Worn Device data
    ii. Wrist Worn Device data

In this prject we have used data wrist worn data and performed a stress detection uskin sklearn

### Machine Learning Model
I have used logistic regretion, Decision Tree and Random Forest models for stress prediction.
